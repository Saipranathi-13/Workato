What is Workato?
It is defined with 2 words called work and automation. Workato is essentially an enterprise garde automation platform
in It finance and all the different departments we can use waorkato and we can build automation.Workato is essentially serverless platform
Workato, It allows users to automate business processess like this in a very usual visual way without a developer skill set.
This is what refer to low code. no code
Tools in workato:
ETL/ELT: involving bulk. Transfer of data could be thousands of records or millions of records.
API Management: can expose your integration to external parties or apps if required, where workato
can also create workflow.
conversational bots are able to build and deploy interactive work bots in the workplace.
Workato environment- workato workspaces- different integrations that will be building our recipes.
1. Dev Workspaces: developing recipes in development team
2. QA workspace: QA team to check your recipe 
3. Prod workspace: all of your instances are connected to your production environment.
Recipes can be migrated from one account to another via the Recipe Lifecycle Management tool.
Each Workato user may be given access to multiple environment.
Recipe is very similar to like a cookbook. It is logical steps that will be executed to meet your integration.
recipe can be create using 2 methods. 1. our own 2. cloning
3 main ingredients of a recipe
1. Connections: all applications need to have connected to your recipe.
2. Trigger: can only be 1, what your recipe will listen for, or this is what will tell your recipe to kick start.
3. actions: all of the steps that you would want to execute in your recipe. no limit for actions.
if we dont have trigger then recipe will not start.
2 ways to share recipe:
1. List recipe: we have list of the recipes
2. Private sharing link: sharing link it will be private.
Connections: when we are connect to other applications inside worato. it allows you to pick authentication options
basic auth, Oauth2, API tokens, custom protocols.It is simple like username and password.
Triggers have different types:
1. Real-time: implemented with web hooks
2. Polling- implemented with web hooks
3. Scheduled- scheduling the time
Trigger events are delivered in the same order as events were created or modified in theapp- workato cursors.
Trigger conditions: you are able to define more information in your triggers if you do not want to process all of the records.
recipe steps can be simple actions, or control flow statements that help you describe business logic.
what work does your recipe do:
1. actions types- adding, searching,updating, deleting
2. control- conditions, loops,error monitor(try-catch), stop, Recipe functions.
3. Data- single, Batch/list.
OOB(out-of-the-box) actions:
   create, update,upsert,search,get delete.
Data mapping- mapping, formulas, lookups.
Recipe data box, this is a placeholder for the information from your previous steps.
data pills: information in recipe box which we have in small boxes with data.
.slice(start_index,length)- get part of a string.
Data types: data pills can be of the following 
string, integer, number, object, date, date time, boolean, Array.list.
Formula Mode- 
split: split up a string based on a delimiter
First: Returns the first iteam in the list.
Upcase: coverts the entire string into upper case
Intelligent business processes:
1. Enterprise-grade foundation
2. citizen integrators
3. Conversational integration
4. It governance 
5. Extensible platform
Levels of functionality:
   1. Data integration: data integration without any manual effort and without data duplication.
   2. Process integration: such as workflow automation, which enables u to create efficent business processes across multiple applications.
   3. Experience integration: can talk to your applications or business processes to send important notifications or carry out commands on your behalf.
Intelligent process automation: It is a workflow that starts with a trigger event and a list of one or more actions.
Workato recipe allows you to automate processes b/w the tools, systems, and apps that you use.
Assets include smart folders for Recipes and Connections you've created in your account. You can also access your Trash bin from here.
Projects help you create, organize, and manage your automation lifecycle to meet your business goals by grouping people and assets that work together.
The Operations hub dashboard allows users to visualize real-time data pertaining to the recipes and connections in their Workato account at a glance. It provides key insights, analytics, and actions so you can discover and resolve issues faster.
Workato Tools help perform three main functions: Build recipes, connect apps and collaborate and manage recipes
Recipes are automated workflows built by users that can span multiple applications and are simple yet powerful. 
The Workato recipe editor is the powerhouse of the Workato platform and the main area of focus throughout this course.

Conditional Actions: set a condition within your recipe to better define the overall workflow processing logic.
Conditional Actions will only be carried out only if the specified condition is true.
2 types of conditional actions:
1. IF- will only be executed when the conditions are met.
2. IF-ELSE- if conditions are true, actions within the if block will be executed . otherwise if false the actions within the else block will be executed.
Workato will work on nested conditional actions.
 we have 3 different fileds to configure conditional actions
1. data field: typically mapped by a dynamic data pill
2. condition: depends on data type 
3. value: mapped by a fixed input value.
conditions are sensitive to data types.
common use cases:
1. Deduplication logic: when you sync over information to other, there would not be the same record combined. 
2. stopping the recipe
3. invoking different function recipes.
4. setting up notifications for different error messages.
Error Handling: used to monitor actions and retry failed steps
configuring error monitoring and handling:
1. retry the sequence of actions
2. take remedial actions
common mistakes:
1. using too much try/catch
2. neglecting to mark the job as "failed" when using the stop action
We do not have limit to create the nested monitor blocks.
Maximum error retries that can use is 3 times and can also change the interval b/w these 3 tries. it can be 6 or 4 or 1 seconds.
Repeat Actions: Loop through a list of records
The repeat action is useful for going through that certain batch of records.
Repeat action is useful to go through each item in your batch dispatch.
common use cases:
1. csv/database rows
2. order line items
3. any type of list/array
Variables: placeholder to store data used to refer the information and also we can manipulate the information
common use cases of variables:
Transforming data
   Formulas- reducing complexity with variables
   Lists
An uninitialized variable has a value of null or nill.
Environment properties can be re-used in recipes. 
Default value of a variable with a type of "integer" if it is not specified by the user- nill

Lookup tables: mini-database table
organized like a database table with columns and rows of data. 
common use cases:
static reference data
temporary logs/error handling
compiling data for daily reports
mistakes: 
storing large amounts of data
storing lookup data that already exists in source systems.
The total no of rows we can retrieve from a lookup table: 10,000


Every application consists of 3 pillars:
    1. Data storage: enables u to store data in data tables and access your data through the workflow app connector.
    2. The user interface for business users in Workflow apps portal. It is partially generated by Workato, and partially customized by creating Pages.
    3. Business Logic: The logic of the application, implemented in Workato recipes.
Data tables: Workato Data Tables provide robust, scalable, and secure structured data storage in Workato. It enables you to define data tables in projects.


Technical beginner:

create intelligent process automation workflows to remove the need for labor and manual tasks this increases the predictability of services as well as reduces error from manual tasks.
Basic building blocks:
   1. Trigger event: by using conditions as part of the workflow logic to determine the action that needs to be taken.
   2. Actions: data points of each item in the list to determine which best suits your needs this is called a repeat action: as u repeat a set of steps to determine actions that are performed.
   3. End
every recipe works on its own container.
Workbot lets u build customized bots to automate ur workflows.
projects are flexible way to organize ur automation.
dependences: relation ship b/w the connections and recipes
connections: secure way to give access to ur business applications
it notifies an ops team abount the escalated issuse using pagerduty
authentication grants ur team access to the data of your business applications
each app provides different ways to authenticate
basic-username and password
Triggers are events that kick off a recipe.Triggers are time-based, event-based.
Actions are set of tasks u want to automate.
Mappings control the data flow in automation.
API: Application Programming Interface. This isthe software layer between two applications that allows them to talk to one another. See this post from a competitor, which explains APIs well.
API Management is the practice of cataloguing and documenting APIs and making them available for use within a company and by it's suppliers
and/or customers. This also involves governance and security considerations.
Applicant Tracking System, (Examples: Greenhouse, Oracle Taleo). Prospects and customers using Workato for rapid employee growth will likely want to build recipes for their ATS.

3 fundamental use cases for automation: 
   1. Data consistency:
   2. multi step process: 
   3. composite services:
