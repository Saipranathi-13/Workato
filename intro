What is Workato?
It is defined with 2 words called work and automation. Workato is essentially an enterprise garde automation platform
in It finance and all the different departments we can use waorkato and we can build automation.Workato is essentially serverless platform
Workato, It allows users to automate business processess like this in a very usual visual way without a developer skill set.
This is what refer to low code. no code
Tools in workato:
ETL/ELT: involving bulk. Transfer of data could be thousands of records or millions of records.
API Management: can expose your integration to external parties or apps if required, where workato
can also create workflow.
conversational bots are able to build and deploy interactive work bots in the workplace.
Workato environment- workato workspaces- different integrations that will be building our recipes.
1. Dev Workspaces: developing recipes in development team
2. QA workspace: QA team to check your recipe 
3. Prod workspace: all of your instances are connected to your production environment.
Recipes can be migrated from one account to another via the Recipe Lifecycle Management tool.
Each Workato user may be given access to multiple environment.
Recipe is very similar to like a cookbook. It is logical steps that will be executed to meet your integration.
recipe can be create using 2 methods. 1. our own 2. cloning
3 main ingredients of a recipe
1. Connections: all applications need to have connected to your recipe.
2. Trigger: can only be 1, what your recipe will listen for, or this is what will tell your recipe to kick start.
3. actions: all of the steps that you would want to execute in your recipe. no limit for actions.
if we dont have trigger then recipe will not start.
2 ways to share recipe:
1. List recipe: we have list of the recipes
2. Private sharing link: sharing link it will be private.
Connections: when we are connect to other applications inside worato. it allows you to pick authentication options
basic auth, Oauth2, API tokens, custom protocols.It is simple like username and password.
Triggers have different types:
1. Real-time: implemented with web hooks
2. Polling- implemented with web hooks
3. Scheduled- scheduling the time
Trigger events are delivered in the same order as events were created or modified in theapp- workato cursors.
Trigger conditions: you are able to define more information in your triggers if you do not want to process all of the records.
recipe steps can be simple actions, or control flow statements that help you describe business logic.
what work does your recipe do:
1. actions types- adding, searching,updating, deleting
2. control- conditions, loops,error monitor(try-catch), stop, Recipe functions.
3. Data- single, Batch/list.
OOB(out-of-the-box) actions:
   create, update,upsert,search,get delete.
Data mapping- mapping, formulas, lookups.
Recipe data box, this is a placeholder for the information from your previous steps.
data pills: information in recipe box which we have in small boxes with data.
.slice(start_index,length)- get part of a string.
Data types: data pills can be of the following 
string, integer, number, object, date, date time, boolean, Array.list.
Formula Mode- 
split: split up a string based on a delimiter
First: Returns the first iteam in the list.
Upcase: converts the entire string into upper case.
Testing ensures your automation's behavior and data processing are correct.
The Operations hub dashboard, accessed through the navigation bar, allows you to visualize real-time data pertaining to the recipes and connections in your Workato account at a glance.
If the recipe is edited and saved, the recipe will increment to a new version.
Types of recipe changes : 
   1. schema changes: changing the schema of the recipe
   2. logic changes: changing the logic of the recipe
3 parts of the setting tab
   1. general: you can choose the concurrency number depending on the number of jobs the recipe processes simultaneously. You can also select a higher number for high-volume transactions.
   2. data retention: you can set a data retention policy as instructed by your organization or team.
   3. sharing: you can list your recipe in the Workato Community Library.
Running a test job requires:
   A fully configured trigger
   Valid data mappings
   Valid connections
The Workato Community Library contains integrations and workflow automations built by the Workato community. Find, clone, and personalize them to your specific needs.
Intelligent business processes:
1. Enterprise-grade foundation
2. citizen integrators
3. Conversational integration
4. It governance 
5. Extensible platform
Levels of functionality:
   1. Data integration: data integration without any manual effort and without data duplication.
   2. Process integration: such as workflow automation, which enables u to create efficent business processes across multiple applications.
   3. Experience integration: can talk to your applications or business processes to send important notifications or carry out commands on your behalf.
Intelligent process automation: It is a workflow that starts with a trigger event and a list of one or more actions.
Workato recipe allows you to automate processes b/w the tools, systems, and apps that you use.
Assets include smart folders for Recipes and Connections you've created in your account. You can also access your Trash bin from here.
Projects help you create, organize, and manage your automation lifecycle to meet your business goals by grouping people and assets that work together.
The Operations hub dashboard allows users to visualize real-time data pertaining to the recipes and connections in their Workato account at a glance. It provides key insights, analytics, and actions so you can discover and resolve issues faster.
Workato Tools help perform three main functions: Build recipes, connect apps and collaborate and manage recipes
Recipes are automated workflows built by users that can span multiple applications and are simple yet powerful. 
The Workato recipe editor is the powerhouse of the Workato platform and the main area of focus throughout this course.










Automation pro 2



Conditional Actions: set a condition within your recipe to better define the overall workflow processing logic.
Conditional Actions will only be carried out only if the specified condition is true.
2 types of conditional actions:
1. IF- will only be executed when the conditions are met.
2. IF-ELSE- if conditions are true, actions within the if block will be executed . otherwise if false the actions within the else block will be executed.
Workato will work on nested conditional actions.
 we have 3 different fileds to configure conditional actions
1. data field: typically mapped by a dynamic data pill
2. condition: depends on data type 
3. value: mapped by a fixed input value.
conditions are sensitive to data types.
common use cases:
1. Deduplication logic: when you sync over information to other, there would not be the same record combined. 
2. stopping the recipe
3. invoking different function recipes.
4. setting up notifications for different error messages.
Error Handling: used to monitor actions and retry failed steps
configuring error monitoring and handling:
1. retry the sequence of actions
2. take remedial actions
we can retry 3 times in the monitor action block.
common mistakes:
1. using too much try/catch
2. neglecting to mark the job as "failed" when using the stop action
We do not have limit to create the nested monitor blocks.
Maximum error retries that can use is 3 times and can also change the interval b/w these 3 tries. it can be 6 or 4 or 1 seconds.
Repeat Actions: Loop through a list of records
The repeat action is useful for going through that certain batch of records.
Repeat action is useful to go through each item in your batch dispatch.
common use cases:
1. csv/database rows
2. order line items
3. any type of list/array
Variables: placeholder to store data used to refer the information and also we can manipulate the information
common use cases of variables:
Transforming data
   Formulas- reducing complexity with variables
   Lists- simplify operations and actions on muti-row outputs of lists
           Basic Lists: rows are self-contained where all the information required is explicitly expressed in each filed
            nested list: details of the rows in a paremt list are contained in a separate child list.
Mapping data in List
   1. Directly into an action without list processing:
   2. Into an action with a repeat step 
   3. into an action with a list input
Processing list in recipes:
    1. search records in an application(search related action)
    2. Get list of records
    3. Processing CSV rows
An uninitialized variable has a value of null or nill.
Environment properties can be re-used in recipes. 
Default value of a variable with a type of "integer" if it is not specified by the user- nill

Lookup tables: mini-database table
organized like a database table with columns and rows of data. 
common use cases:
static reference data
temporary logs/error handling
compiling data for daily reports
mistakes: 
storing large amounts of data
storing lookup data that already exists in source systems.
The total no of rows we can retrieve from a lookup table: 10,000


Every application consists of 3 pillars:
    1. Data storage: enables u to store data in data tables and access your data through the workflow app connector.
    2. The user interface for business users in Workflow apps portal. It is partially generated by Workato, and partially customized by creating Pages.
    3. Business Logic: The logic of the application, implemented in Workato recipes.
Data tables: Workato Data Tables provide robust, scalable, and secure structured data storage in Workato. It enables you to define data tables in projects.


Technical beginner:

create intelligent process automation workflows to remove the need for labor and manual tasks this increases the predictability of services as well as reduces error from manual tasks.
Basic building blocks:
   1. Trigger event: by using conditions as part of the workflow logic to determine the action that needs to be taken.
   2. Actions: data points of each item in the list to determine which best suits your needs this is called a repeat action: as u repeat a set of steps to determine actions that are performed.
   3. End
every recipe works on its own container.
Workbot lets u build customized bots to automate ur workflows.
projects are flexible way to organize ur automation.
dependences: relation ship b/w the connections and recipes
connections: secure way to give access to ur business applications
it notifies an ops team abount the escalated issuse using pagerduty
authentication grants ur team access to the data of your business applications
each app provides different ways to authenticate
basic-username and password
Triggers are events that kick off a recipe.Triggers are time-based, event-based.
Actions are set of tasks u want to automate.
Mappings control the data flow in automation.
API: Application Programming Interface. This isthe software layer between two applications that allows them to talk to one another. See this post from a competitor, which explains APIs well.
API Management is the practice of cataloguing and documenting APIs and making them available for use within a company and by it's suppliers
and/or customers. This also involves governance and security considerations.
Applicant Tracking System, (Examples: Greenhouse, Oracle Taleo). Prospects and customers using Workato for rapid employee growth will likely want to build recipes for their ATS.
BA or BSA Business Analyst or Business Systems Analyst. These describe job titles that are our most common ICP for our direct platform offering. 
3 fundamental use cases for automation: 
   1. Data consistency:
   2. multi step process: 
   3. composite services:




Workato fit 101

The business process: the set of actions and activities that different people or different roles doing task to get an outcome.
Integration: allows data to flow b/w different business applications.(Accessing data from apps)
Automation:(process & task focused)  It is the technology-enabled automation of tasks or business processes
How integration and automation work together: Integration at the core of automation
Integration (data automation)-->Task automation--> Process automation--> Enterprise automation.
Different types of integration:
         Swivel chain integration(Fully manual): their is a person they lookup data from one application and re-type the data in other application.
         File-based integration: (80% comapny's use this apporach) export the data one system and store that data in csv file and then converts into the file which the other system can read.
         API-based integration: one system system send the data by using API and then the data can be in any format to the other application in that application we can update the data.
         UI-based integration: UI will lookup data in one application screen and then enter data in other application screen.
         Database integration: effectively connect to the data base application and select the data and we can push the data directly to the other applications database.
         Mixed interface Integration: get the data from one application and transfer the data into file and then push the data into other application.
Problems in using custom scripts and code:
         unreliable
         difficult to support
         very time intensive
         like jenga-can easily crumble 
         can't easily monitor
         limited experts understand it
Enterprise Automation: It is a platform category aimed at combining experience,process, and data integration capadilities in a single low-code platfome in order to provide both technical and non-technical users the ability to rapidly automate end-to-end business processes.

Recipe function: type of a recipe that can be called from another recipe.
This helps to reduce the length of your recipes by separating a repeatable set of actions.
Use of recipe function: can save time and make recipe creation easy
features of recipe functions:
1. The child can respond back to the parent recipe with relevant data that would be useful for the rest of the recipe.
When the parent recipe is waiting for data from the child recipe, we call it a "Synchronous execution".
while creating recipe function we will have the
Parameters schema: Define data passed in from parent recipe to pass on to the child or otherwise known as recipe function.
result schema: configure data to return to parent recipe.
recipe functions can be used in Error handling, New customer workflow, new It ticket helpdesk,rehire workflow, reusable update employee workflow.

Enterprise Workbot for slack

Workbot is a bot platform that looks & feels like a custom-built internal app. It allows you to eliminate app-hopping and bridge your business applications into one interface,right within slack.
Instead of switching b/w multiple windows, bots provide a minimalistic presentation of critical actions in a single pane of glass.
How does work bot works:
      1. connect to any app with APIs like REST and SOAP, databases,or file systems.
      2. Define the trigger
      3. Define the actions
      4. Execute the workflow
2 simple kinds of bots:
         1. Click-navigation chatbot: involoves through a consistent and predictable UI to execute tasks.
         2. Natural language chatbots:which utilize AI from tools and engines like Google Dialogflow, Amazon lex, and IBM wtason to provide a conversational experience in executing tasks.
Accelerators are Workato's pre-packaged solutions for common automations with high resuability across industries.
Lead Bot: An intuitive bot whose goal is to deliver, review,qualify and assign leads-all with a custom UX designed for speed.
Lead bot helps in:
      Book more meetings
      connect with leads
      create a top-tier experience for new customers
Firefighter Bot: a helpful assistant focused on facilitating internal requests.
      putting out fires
      solve many small problems at once
using this bot we can set automatic reminders and escalations and create and approve requests, all without leaving your slack window.
this is more used for IT helpdesk and lifecycle management.
HR bot: helping you execute end-to-end hiring, onboarding and other HR processess.
This bot makes it easy to review feedback from candidate interview panels that would normally live within a recuriting systems.
3-Worded new command trigger: to uniquely identify & execute wrokbot for slack recipes for their specific workflows.
Slash command is a trigger that's baked into a 3-worded new command trigger. this menas that a workbot recipe can be trigger from both slack interactive components such as slack buttons, select menus, Datapickers etc. and by typing slash "/" followed by the command name.
Global shortcut: similar to a slash command can ne invoked anywhere in slack execute a workflow that doesn.t require context.
Message shortcut: useful in workflows where the starting point is a slack message you'd like to extract with other background details.
The New Dynamic Menu Event Trigger is used to dynamically present a list of options in a select menu based on what users type in real time.
      Trigger that is always paired with a return menu options action.
      Always involves a minimum of 2 recipes
      A parent recipe that creates the select menu.
      A child recipe is invoked from the parent recipe to perform three important things.
The child recipe:
         1. It monitors for dynamic menu events from dynamic menus in modals or trigger parameters.
         2. It dynamically retrieves menu options from backend systems, based on the type-ahead and any search parameters
         3. It returns the menu options to the primary or parent recipe, which will the continue the workflow.
Tips to improve your post:
         1. slack markdown and emojis
         2. Attachement Message field
         3. Attachment colors
         4. Attachment title links



Batch/Bulk processing:
It is a method of running high-volume,repetitive data jobs.
The batch method allows users to process data with little or no use interaction.
Why batch processing:
      efficient way of moving large volumes of data across systems.
Use cases:
      Business intelligence
      case management
      order management
      Marketing operations
      file upload
      Multi-instamce sync
Batch triggers:
Batching enables you to process multiple rows of data or multiple records with just one job.
Batch actions are typically of the form:
      create batch
      update batch
      upsert batch records: it updates if the record exists or creates, if the record doesn't exist.
               Updates or creates multiple records in a single action
               requires a list of records with id's to be updated as the input
Bulk Actions: It ensures that you can do large quantities of processing while minimizing the users wait time.
Useful in business processes that requires mass data transcations and syncing data information.
Difference b/w batch and bulk
         1. when using batch processing it can control the no of records or data to be used by configuring the batch size.
         2. For bulk actions, it pushes large amounts of data in one go.
create bulk:
      create list of new records in a single action
      Field configuration allows data mappings for creation of records
Upsert bulk:
      create list of new records in a single actions and update list of exisiting records
      A primary key such as external ID is required to determine whether a record exists



CSV tools by Workato


CSV file overview:
Comma separated values(CSV) file:this files are the one of the most commonly used files for exchanging information b/w system architecutures.
      Text file
      Stores tabular data
      Human-readable plain text
      Each line=one data record
      same no of fields
      separated by comma
Delimiters: A delimiter is a sequence of one or more characters for specifying the boundary between separate, independent regions in plain text, mathematical expressions or other data streams. 
Enclosing characters: You can also specify enclosing characters that mark both the start and end of a region of text, such as single or double quotation marks.
CSV use cases in workato: Keep track of client calls
To convert CSV content into usable datapills, you can parse them with Workato's built-in CSV parser or try a connector-specific CSV parser.
Certain connectors have triggers/actions that can parse CSV content. These are called connector-specific parsers or external parsers.
csv tools by workato:Workato tool available as an action in any recipe and can parse up to 50k rows.
Parsing with CSV Tools by Workato: 

Working with databases: 

All database connectors give you the option to connect through an on-prem agent.
To connect to a relational database in a virtual machine, we need:
         username and password
         windows authentication
         hostname + port of the database
To interact with your tables, the lowest set of privileges of the connected user should be set.
Connected user requires at least select privileges for chosen database.
Different triggers in database:
         New row
         New row/updated row(batch)
         New row via custom sql
         New row/updated row via custom SQL: using sql queries
         Scheduled query(batch): this will execute sql query in specified schedule
RDBMS apps can dispatch in batch/bulk processes. 
Triggers with batch/bulk processes can be used when dealing with hundrends or thousands of records.
Performing CRUD(create, read,update,delete) operations:
other that crud we have select and execute



RecipeOps:


Recipe Ops is a connector in Workato that enables the building of recipes to monitor and manage other recipes. Workato customers use RecipeOps to automate monitoring and recovery from errors and for other administrative functions.

Recipe Watch(Status and health):
      Monitor mission-critical automation
      Automatically start/stop during planned downtimes
      Status reporting
Automated Recovery(reduce unplanned downtime)
      Reduce unplanned downtime
      Custom workflows based on error types and messages
      Lossless pause, resume, auto-retry
Intelligent operations(rule based ops and bots):
      Custom rule-based bots, reporting, recovering
      Workflows when new collaborators join
Triggers in recipeops:
         Failed Jobs: The failed job trigger is able to monitor all active recipes or selected recipes, for failed jobs. This is useful in ensuring that key recipes are monitored and corrective actions, including notifications, can be automated.
         Recipe Started/Stopped by Workato/User: This trigger allows users to build contingencies for key recipes that should/not be started/stopped. For example, enforce a restart logic or setup customer escalation policies to inform key personnel when the recipe has been stopped.
         Account Connected/Disconnected: These trigger monitors apps connected/disconnected in Workato. On occasions, app connections can become invalid due to several reasons:
                        app credentials were changed and the connection was not updated correspondingly in Workato
                        connected user doesn't have the right set of permissions to read/write selected records
                        permissions of the connected user were changed to a reduced scope
         Customer Usage Threshold Reached: This will monitor all customers and triggers when a customer reaches thresholds of their usage limits for tasks according to their plan. Users will receive an event for every 10% of usage.
         Member Invitation Accepted: For Workato users who are team owners, admins, or have been given permissions to, they can monitor their collaborators who they have invited in their Team workspace.
         Packaged Deployed: Using this trigger will receive a notification when a package is deployed in your Workato Account.
Actions in recipeops:
            Stop/Start Recipe: This allows specified recipes to be started/stopped. A single recipe can be selected from a picklist. Alternatively, a selected recipe can be specified by ID.
            Get Account Details: Get information about the Workato account, such as subscription plan type, allotted and remaining transaction counts, recipe, and connection counts.
            Search Job History: This action lists the last 100 jobs by default. This action lets
                                 Users filter by job status e.g. show failed jobs only
                                 Users filter by date range as well
            Rerun Jobs: Using RecipeOps can help to rerun singular or bulk jobs in a specified recipe. This action requires a Job ID to be rerun. 
                        Usually these datapill can be retrieved from a RecipeOps trigger/action.
                        Dynamic list - Use this if the number of items or their content depends on another list. This is the most common input mode used. 
                        Fixed list - Use this if you know the total number of items and their content. This input mode is infrequently used.
                        List Connection: This action is useful to display the details of a specific connection or a list of connections. Connections can be filtered by name or recipe. Result is limited to 1000 recently updated connections.

HTTP connector


Workato HTTP Connector enables you to build integrations with any cloud applications that have an HTTP-based API and to build additional actions on the Workato platform.
Pros and cons of HTTP conector:
     Pro: The HTTP connectors enables quick connectivity to custom applications or application connections not yet available through workato.
      Cons: connectors is unable to handle certain complex API functionality.
      Pro: It is suitable for one-off requirements to connect to add/or perform an action within an application.
      Cons: Actions are not scalable.
There are two common types of web service APIs: Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) and Representational State Transfer (REST).
Workato communicates with any API using HTTP Connector:
      connections & Authorization
      request
      response
HTTP actions enable you to create custom requests and response schemas for HTTP-based APIs.
After you have setup your HTTP connection, you can now configure HTTP actions. Within the HTTP connector, you have the choice of two actions:
            Send request
            Send request and wait for response (private preview)
